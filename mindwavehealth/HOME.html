            <H1>Health Tips:</H1>
            <p>Nutrition: Aim to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. They’re packed with essential
                vitamins,
                fiber, and antioxidants that help keep your body in top shape. Cut down on processed foods—whole
                foods
                are
                your best friends.

                Exercise: Try to move your body for at least 30 minutes each day. It doesn’t have to be hardcore
                gym
                workouts—dancing, walking, or yoga are all fantastic. Consistency is key.

                Sleep: Prioritize sleep . Adults typically need 7-9 hours per night. A consistent sleep schedule
                can
                greatly
                improve your mood, productivity, and overall health. Avoid screens an hour before bed to help
                wind
                down.

                Hydration: Drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated helps with digestion, energy levels, and even
                skin
                health. Aim for 8 glasses a day, but listen to your body—some may need more, some less.

                Mental Health: Practice mindfulness or meditation to reduce stress. Even 5-10 minutes a day can
                make
                a
                big
                difference. Don't hesitate to talk to a friend or a professional if you're feeling overwhelmed.

                Preventive Care: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can catch potential issues
                early.
                Don't
                skip your annual physicals, screenings, and vaccinations.</p>

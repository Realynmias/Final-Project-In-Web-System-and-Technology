                <h2>The Importance of Nutrition for Overall Health</h2>
                <p>Nutrition plays a critical role in maintaining overall health and well-being. A balanced diet
                    provides
                    essential nutrients that the body needs to function correctly and stave off diseases</p>
                <p>The Benefits of a Balanced Diet</p>
                <p>●Weight Management: Consuming a variety of nutrient-rich foods helps maintain a healthy weight.</p>

                    diabetes,
                    and cancer.</p>
                <p>●Enhanced Mood and Energy Levels: Proper nutrition supports mental health and keeps energy levels
                    stable.
